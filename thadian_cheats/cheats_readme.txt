This is designed to be a minimum impact mod, and should be 
compatible with everything™. 

Cheats! adds a set of decisions, minor titles, and traits you can use. 
Most of these cheats are in a menu inside the Intrigue Tab 
(to not clutter your tab). 

Some of these cheats are: 
Remove Crap Traits from self. 
Remove Crap Traits from your dynasty children. 
Add a free Doomstack!! 
Summon 5 year old Strong Genius Attractive son 
Summon 5 year old Strong Genius Attractive daughter 

Because you cannot use Console in Cheat Multiplayer: 
Piety 
Gold 
Prestige 
Techpoints 

Each by 1000 per use. 

Add/Remove a list of customized Cheat Traits! 
(These are OP versions of my personal traits). 
Minor Titles to grant excellent boons - or terrible misfortune. 


You might find a bug, or a mod this is not compatible with. 
If so, use Steam Forum to report errors. 

You may use this mod as a base for your own work! 
Pay attention to file structure, ask questions if you need. 

Don't forget to credit me. I made this mod to learn how to mod, 
and this is one of the results. If you are interested in learning 
how to mod, this should be easy to follow inside the files. 

This mod will continue to evolve and develop. 

Here are some good places to help you learn modding. 
Look at modifiers and how they are used by different elements of 
the game. Modding is fun!
